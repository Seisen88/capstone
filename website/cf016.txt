Title 1: 
BINHI: A Web and Mobile Systems for Localized Cooperative Seed Subsidy and Farmer Engagement Support


SYSTEMS OVERVIEW
Based on the findings of the BINHI study, a persistent challenge in seed management among agricultural cooperatives is the lack of active farmer participation in key decisions, particularly in seed allocation processes. Farmers are often left uninformed or have limited channels to communicate feedback and concerns to cooperative officers. This gap leads to a lack of transparency, reduced trust, and seed distribution that may not always align with farmers' actual needs or seasonal requirements. Furthermore, the study highlighted a need for more direct mechanisms for farmers to report problems, check schedules, and receive important alerts, as well as for cooperatives to streamline inventory tracking, delivery scheduling, and member coordination.

To address these critical gaps, this system proposes a comprehensive web and mobile based platform. Key features include a user management module for role based access (farmers and officers), a seed request and allocation module allowing farmers to submit requests and track status, and a cooperative decision board module to facilitate polls and voting for inclusive decision making. A live chat and support module will enable real time communication between farmers and cooperative staff for guidance and issue resolution. Additionally, notifications module will provide automated updates on distribution schedules and meetings, while a feedback module will allow farmers to submit feedback on seed quality and raise concerns.

This system is intended to help by providing a digital space for inclusive participation and structured decision making, ensuring that farmers’ voices are captured and considered in real time. By fostering direct communication and transparency in seed subsidy allocation and cooperative governance, the platform aims to promote greater trust, accountability, and ultimately, enhance the effectiveness and responsiveness of seed management practices within agricultural cooperatives in Negros Occidental.


SYSTEMS OBJECTIVES
The system aims to enhance farmer participation in cooperative decision-making and seed allocation processes by providing transparent and accessible digital platforms. The system has the following specific objectives: 
To create a website for cooperative officers to manage seed allocation plans, distribute information, and track farmer polls and feedback results
To create a mobile application for farmers to access cooperative updates, participate in allocation discussions through polls and chat, and easily submit concerns or inputs
To evaluate the overall usability of BINHI using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire

Title 2: 
BINHI: A web and mobile applications for seed subsidy tracking and farmer’s feedback mechanisms 

SYSTEMS OVERVIEW
The BINHI study revealed a significant gap in the current seed subsidy implementation, while farmers receive seeds, there is little to no structured evaluation of whether the distributed seeds led to optimal yields or were appropriate for specific areas. the absence of post distribution feedback loops limits the cooperatives’ and local government units' ability to improve their programs, leading to issues like limited seed selection, insufficient coverage, and a lack of proper regional seasonal alignment. this results in fragmented support systems and hinders data driven adjustments for future allocations, impacting the long term sustainability and effectiveness of the subsidy program.

To address this shortfall, this system proposes to digitize seed subsidy allocation and tracking by integrating yield reporting and farmer feedback into the subsidy process. key features include a user registration and profile module for detailed farm and farmer information, a seed subsidy application module for streamlined requests and status tracking, and a robust yield input and analytics module where farmers can submit harvest data, which the system will compare with seed input for analysis. a feedback and rating module will enable farmers to rate seed quality and timeliness, logging trends for future improvements. for cooperative officers, a report generation module will provide automated reports on allocation efficiency and yield correlation, complemented by a monitoring dashboard for a comprehensive overview of distributions, yield data, and farmer participation insights.

This system is intended to help by enabling data driven adjustments for future allocations and better support for underperforming recipients. by establishing a transparent and responsive ecosystem for seed support programs, it will allow cooperatives and LGUs to fine tune seed distribution strategies based on measurable yield outcomes and direct farmer inputs, ensuring that subsidies are more effective, evidence based, and contribute directly to enhanced agricultural productivity and reduced inequalities.







SYSTEMS OBJECTIVES
The system aims to digitize the allocation, tracking, and evaluation of seed subsidies by integrating post-harvest yield data and farmer feedback. The system has the following specific objectives:
To create a website for cooperative managers to analyze incoming yield data, track subsidy disbursements, and make evidence-based improvements in allocation strategies.
To create a mobile application for farmers to request seeds, record their harvest yields, and rate the quality of the seeds they received. 
To evaluate the overall usability of BINHI using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire.

Title 3: 
BINHI: An IoT and Mobile Approach on Smart Seed Storage System for Quality Controlled Seed Management

SYSTEMS OVERVIEW
The BINHI study identified a critical challenge in seed management, improper seed storage, particularly with regard to pest control and moisture management, leads to significant quality degradation before seeds even reach the farmers. Cooperatives often lack adequate infrastructure and real time monitoring systems to ensure seeds are stored under ideal conditions, resulting in poor germination rates, reduced seed viability, and substantial pre distribution losses. This issue is exacerbated by environmental exposure to moisture, pests, or extreme temperatures, and a lack of proper seed packaging or containers.

To directly address these problems, this proposal introduces BINHI - An IoT and Mobile Approach on Smart Seed Storage System for Quality Controlled Seed Management. The core of the system is an IoT system equipped with a sensor monitoring module that tracks humidity, temperature, and air flow in real time. This data feeds into a seed quality alert system that sends immediate notifications via a mobile dashboard module to cooperative staff when storage conditions deviate from safe thresholds. The system also incorporates an automated ventilation control module to trigger cooling or fan systems when thresholds are breached, and a maintenance log and reporting module to track pest treatments and maintenance schedules. A user access module manages registration and role based access to specific storage units.

This system is intended to help by deploying an IoT powered smart container system that actively maintains ideal storage environments and provides a mobile interface for continuous monitoring. By mitigating pre distribution losses and ensuring that distributed seeds remain viable and effective for planting, this innovative solution will significantly enhance seed quality, extend seed longevity, and contribute to more resilient and productive agricultural practices within cooperatives in Negros Occidental.

SYSTEMS OBJECTIVES
The system aims to maintain the quality and viability of seeds by providing a smart storage solution that monitors and controls environmental conditions. The system aims to specifically address the following objectives:
To create an IoT System that tracks humidity, temperature, and airflow in real-time within the storage containers. 
To create a mobile application that gives cooperative staff and other authorized users access to live storage condition data, system alerts, and maintenance logs.
To evaluate the overall usability of BINHI using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire.
